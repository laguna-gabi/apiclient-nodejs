## üí° Project introduction

This project handles all shared data, interfaces and logic for sending data to [iris](https://github.com/LagunaHealth/iris)

## üìã Prerequisites

### Installation

install all dependencies in [package.json](./package.json) file by running the following command:

```bash
$ yarn
```

### Aws

In order to work locally with aws cli and `package.json` dependencies, install

1. install [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html) (will be easy for working with aws on terminal)
2. [set up](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html) credentials on your local computer (make sure to set region to `us-east-1`)
   > **_Don't skip aws setup:_** This step is critical to develop locally on this project.
   > We're loading configurations(api keys and tokens for external providers such as
   > [sendbird](https://sendbird.com), [onesignal](https://onesignal.com), [twilio](https://www.twilio.com), etc...)
   > from [aws secrets manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

### Shared code settings

1. Set up your ide to run with `.prettierrc` file which exists on the main root of the project.
2. Set up your ide to run with `.eslintrc.js` file which exists on the main root of the project.

## üè† Working locally

When working locally we would like to be able to test our changes in `Hepius` and `Iris`.

For that reason we create a snapshot for every commit you make on a _Pull Request_, this snapshot consists of the current version of pandora with that hash of the commit.

you can find the snapshot version that was created in the _Pull Request_ page as a comment with the coverage. Simply paste the snapshot version in the `package.json` of the project you want to test

```json
  .
  .
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@lagunahealth/pandora": "[the version commented on the PR]",
  .
  .
```

and run `$ yarn` to install the snapshot package.
